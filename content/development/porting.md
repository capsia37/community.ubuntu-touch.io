# Welcome to Ubuntu Touch porting in the nutshell

Featuring a slick and easy-to-use interface based on the design of its predecessor, Canonical's Unity desktop environment, lomiri is the new name of Unity8 and all its related projects. Additionally, the interface that developers use to call on these projects will change. However, developers will only need to update to the new API when they'd like to package their apps for other distributions.
